# Backend modules and providers

Registration lives in [medusa-config.ts](../../medusa-config.ts).
Native Mercur/Medusa modules remain the backend core.

| [inventory](inventory/README.md)                               | Extends pinned native inventory service/repositories for concurrency.                     |

Modules own persistence. [Workflows](../workflows/README.md) orchestrate
cross-domain mutations, with [links](../links/README.md) and native Query for
relationships. Preserve native migration history when extending a module;
inventory's README explains its version-specific integration.

Stripe is TEST-only and finance is not development complete. The operation
journal is not yet a complete immutable financial ledger. See the
[audit](../../../../docs/develpment/development-completion-audit.md) and
[implementation plan](../../../../docs/develpment/development-implementation-plan.md).
