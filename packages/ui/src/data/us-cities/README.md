# United States address locality suggestions

The state files are derived from [GeoNames US postal codes](https://download.geonames.org/export/zip/US.zip), downloaded on **2026-10-03**. Attribution: [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/). The [current postal dataset readme](https://download.geonames.org/export/zip/readme.txt) identifies the license as **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0**, [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Retain this attribution and provide a GeoNames link in the address autocomplete. The readme also retains an older 3.0 link; its stated license version is 4.0.

- Source archive SHA-256: `b0c65ad3661c2dbda1d833f72b5e3402a886d3759f040b35e6bfa7ad5241f5b3`
- Source: 41,490 postal records; output: 29,540 state/locality pairs.
- Coverage: all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, matching `US_STATES`. Territories and military postal regions are outside this catalog.
- Transformation: retain US rows with a supported state code, trim place names, deduplicate names within each state (case insensitive), sort names using ordinal case-insensitive comparison, and output one JSON array per state. Source spelling is retained; no cities are invented or population thresholds applied.

Postal localities can include unincorporated places, neighborhoods, and postal names that are not incorporated cities. This snapshot is an autocomplete catalog, **not address validation or a guarantee of deliverability, accuracy, completeness, or current USPS acceptance**. New names and alternate spellings may be absent. Do not treat membership in this catalog as proof that a street address exists.

`loadUsCities(province)` loads only the selected state's bundled JSON. There are no external runtime requests or API keys. Unknown states return an empty list; failed chunk loads reject so callers can show a retry state. `normalizeUsState` accepts state codes, `US-XX` codes, and full English state names, and returns the existing lowercase two-letter code or an empty string.

## Reimport

Run from the repository root in PowerShell; no additional packages are required:

```powershell
$cityArchive = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'marketplace-geonames-us.zip'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://download.geonames.org/export/zip/US.zip' -OutFile $cityArchive
& ./packages/ui/scripts/import-us-cities.ps1 -ArchivePath $cityArchive
```

The importer validates all state buckets before writing, and prints the source hash and counts. An archive with the recorded hash reproduces these files. The source URL can change; after an intentional refresh, review the diff and update this file's retrieval date, hash, counts, and any license changes.

Run the catalog regression tests with the existing vendor TypeScript test runner:

```powershell
pnpm --dir apps/vendor exec tsx --test ../../packages/ui/tests/us-address-data.test.ts
```
