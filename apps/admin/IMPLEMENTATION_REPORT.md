# Admin Next.js implementation report

## Delivered

- Independent Next.js 16.3.4 App Router application on port 7000.
- `/dashboard` operator shell with desktop and Radix-backed mobile navigation,
  sticky header, summary cards, a review queue table, catalog mix, an operational
  empty state, and a prominent fixture disclaimer.
- `/login` visual shell with disabled fields and submit action. It does not
  capture credentials or implement authentication.
- Source-owned shadcn/ui-style primitives for buttons, badges, cards, inputs,
  labels, separators, sheets, and tables.
- Tailwind CSS v4 CSS-first theme using semantic tokens, Geist typography, and
  direct named imports from `lucide-react`.
- Static fixtures whose IDs, entities, labels, banners, and section badges make
  their demonstration-only status explicit.

## References consulted

- Context7 current documentation for Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and
  Lucide React. Context7 did not expose an exact 16.3.4 snapshot, so the local
  installed Next.js 16.3.4 package was also checked.
- Mercur 2.3.3 bundled documentation: panel extensions, navigation, frontend
  patterns, dashboard configuration, blocks, and admin user guide.
- Medusa Dashboard 2.18.0 local source: shell, responsive sidebar, sidebar
  links, empty-table states, and login information hierarchy.
- Required admin customization skill references for display patterns,
  navigation, and typography, plus Next.js, shadcn, and React guidance.

No Mercur or Medusa implementation source was copied. shadcn/ui-derived
component conventions retain the MIT notice in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Verification

- `node --test apps/admin/tests/admin-smoke.test.mjs`: 3 passed.
- `tsc --noEmit -p apps/admin/tsconfig.json`: passed.
- `eslint .` from `apps/admin`: passed.
- `prettier --check`: passed for all admin source/config/docs.
- `next build` from `apps/admin`: passed on Next.js 16.3.4; `/`, `/dashboard`,
  and `/login` are statically prerendered.
- Static scan found no fetch calls, environment-variable reads, public env
  variables, or embedded credentials in `apps/admin`.
- No Vite UI was started or used for final verification.

## Files

- Project/config: `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `next.config.ts`,
  `postcss.config.mjs`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, and
  `components.json`. Next.js generates the ignored `next-env.d.ts` file.
- Routes/theme: `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/page.tsx`,
  `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`, `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`,
  `src/app/login/page.tsx`.
- Admin components: all files under `src/components/admin`.
- UI source: all files under `src/components/ui`.
- Fixtures/utilities: `src/lib/demo-data.ts`, `src/lib/utils.ts`.
- Documentation/tests: `README.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, this report, and
  `tests/admin-smoke.test.mjs`.

## Known pending work and coordination note

- Authentication, backend SDK integration, live queries, mutations, and full
  administrative routes are intentionally pending and out of scope.
- Root scripts and any Mercur dashboard-module integration were not changed.
- No `pnpm install` or `pnpm add` command was invoked. However, the initial
  `pnpm --dir apps/admin test:smoke` invocation caused pnpm 12 to perform an
  automatic workspace dependency synchronization and created the app links;
  it may also have touched the shared root lockfile. Worker 6 should review and
  own the final root `pnpm-lock.yaml` state as planned.
