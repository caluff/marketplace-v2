# Dates in marketplace-v2

This is a project-maintained skill, not an upstream date-fns skill.

- Inspect the consuming package's manifest and nearby date helpers first. Use
  the declared date-fns version; add a direct dependency with pnpm only in
  packages that actually import it. Do not rely on transitive dependencies.
- Import the functions used, preferably from their public subpaths, such as
  `date-fns/parseISO`, `date-fns/isValid`, and `date-fns/intlFormat`.
- Parse API ISO strings with `parseISO`; retain existing `Date` values. Check
  `isValid` before formatting and use the feature's existing unavailable state.
  Do not silently normalize impossible calendar dates into another month.
- Preserve existing locale, timezone, and output semantics during refactors.
  For localized instants, use `intlFormat(date, options, { locale })` with an
  explicit `options.timeZone`. `format` without a timezone context uses the
  host zone, which can change the day between SSR and the browser.
- Distinguish an instant (ISO timestamp with offset/Z) from a date-only field
  (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Do not treat a date-only value as a UTC instant accidentally.
  Require offsets on new timestamp contracts instead of guessing a host zone.
- Use immutable operations. Do not use display strings for storage, ordering,
  authorization, or release eligibility.
- Calendar days, business days, and elapsed hours are different policies. Before
  implementing a deadline, consult the confirmed phase plan and establish the
  relevant timezone/calendar. Weekend-only `addBusinessDays` does not account
  for public holidays. Add timezone extensions only when the operation needs
  them; do not assume date-fns alone resolves all zoned calendar arithmetic.
- Test invalid and missing values, leap dates, explicit offsets near midnight,
  input immutability, and DST boundaries for zoned calculations. Keep parsing
  tests independent from backend, Redis, and Stripe.

Verify against [upstream documentation](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started)
and the installed version, not examples from a different major release.
